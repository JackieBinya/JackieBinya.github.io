            <p>I recently started contributing to free and open-source software, but that&rsquo;s a story for another day. So well I stumbled upon a bunch of projects with issues open which required help in either completely writing new documentation using <a href="https://gohugo.io/" class="article-link">Hugo </a> or migrating the existing documentation to Hugo.

<h2 id="why-hugo-">Why Hugo ?</h2>
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/5PSPV1ucLX31u/giphy.gif" alt="Confused parrot gif">
<p>Jekyll, VuePress, Gatsby, Gridsome, Hugo !!! Where does one honestly start 🤷🏾‍♀️</p>
<p>Well Hugo, as well as the above-mentioned technologies are collectively known as static site generators. Static site generators are in layman&rsquo;s terms applications which are used to create static HTML websites.</p>
<p>Static websites display web content in the user&rsquo;s web browser exactly as it is stored in the server. Hence every user who visits a static site interacts with exactly the same content. Whereas conversely we have dynamic websites which serve content on a user&rsquo;s browser as it is generated by web applications. Web applications make use complex server-side calls which in turn enable dynamic content to be served to each and every user who visit the site if need be.</p>
<p>Static site generators work by parsing content which is normally written in either <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown" class="article-link">Markdown</a> and/or templating languages, layouts and other meta data and then converting all the source files into HTML. It&rsquo;s important to appreciate that when ever there is a change in the source code, the static site generator re-builds the whole website all over again and uploads it to the server.</p>
<p>Advantages of using static site generators :</p>
<ul>
<li>Better SEO: as all web content is served in simple HTML web scrapers can easily search the site.</li>
<li>Speed: there are no calls made to external databases, static sites are served pretty fast in comparison to dynamic websites.</li>
<li>Improved security since: static sites are independent of databases they are basically hacker-proof.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hugo, stands out because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its open-source.</li>
<li>Its incredible fast 🚀, it is the fastest static site generator to date. Hugo is written using <a href="https://golang.org/"  class="article-link">Golang </a>, using Go makes Hugo build processes incredible fast!</li>
<li>It has a wide variety of themes which make it easy to create a static website, you don&rsquo;t have to start from scratch.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far the only cons I came across when using Hugo were that to fully harness its power you have to know Go. Knowing a little bit of Go gives you so much power in tweaking up themes, which is rather important if you want to give a unique feel to your site despite it being created from a theme. I also would love to express the fact that it took me time to warp my head around how Hugo works despite coming from a solid background in front-end development. So the learning curve is quite steep.</p>
<h2 id="my-experiences-using-hugo">My experiences using Hugo</h2>
<p>My preferred method of learning a new technology is through watching video tutorials.
So for an intro to using Hugo for my personal blog I found the following video tutorials useful.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSiAcyTWU3c&t=510s" class="article-link">Building a Serverless Blog with Hugo and Netlify</a></p>
</li>

</li>
</ol>
<p>After going through the tutorials I followed the Hugo official <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/" class="article-link">documentation</a> on getting started. My theme of choice was <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-anubis/" class="article-link">Anubis</a>, I chose it because its styling is minimalist and clean and most importantly the styling wasn&rsquo;t too opinionated I had lots of room to play around and tweak the styling without having to change a lot of the original styling.</p>
<h2 id="other-technologies-used-in-creating-my-blog">Other Technologies used in creating my blog</h2>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://formspree.io/" class="article-link">FormSpree</a>: is basically a delivery service, it collects form data and then sends email alerts when forms are submitted on static websites. Its integration into a static website is very easy and seamless.</li>
<li><a href="https://pages.github.com/" class="article-link">Github Pages </a>: my site was hosted on GitHub pages, to learn more about Github Pages site hosting service read <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#user--organization-pages" class="article-link">this</a>. Hosting a Hugo site on Github pages isn&rsquo;t a straight-forward task. I advise you to check out the official documentation <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#github-user-or-organization-pages" class="article-link">here</a> on how that can be done.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hugo can be bundled with headless content management systems like <a href="https://www.datocms.com/" class="article-link">DatoCMS</a> to enable it to be harnessed for use by users from non-technical background. Read DatoCMS official <a href="https://www.datocms.com/docs/hugo" class="article-link">documentation</a> to find out about how that can be achieved.</p>
