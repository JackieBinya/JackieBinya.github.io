        <div class="content">
            Historically REST is the accepted standard for designing web APIs.
The main advantages of using REST were:
REST is stateless meaning every server call is independent of any other network calls made to the server. The server will not persist any state about the queries it receives. It provides a structured way to query resources. The problem
REST was intended to be a strict specification used to design APIs but in reality, it was wildly interpreted: most APIs described as being Restful aren&rsquo;t really Restful, they don’t adhere to the strict specification REST APIs have shown to be too inflexible to keep up with the rapidly changing requirements on the client apps that access them.

            Well I have a huge announcement to make! Wait for it&hellip;
I am learning GraphQL 😱
I just finished my first tutorial on EDX. I am pretty stoked about it, its something I have been putting off for months mainly because of two reasons:
I have been insanely busy and, I have been feeling overwhelmed lately about the ton of stuff I have to learn as a developer. When you hear people say as that As a developer the learning never stops, its definitely not a cliche.
