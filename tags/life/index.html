            Well initially I was only meant to go on small haitus but its been 2 years since my last blog in this site!
I have been insanely busy these past 2 years, they feel like a blur in my memory, where did the time go? My responsibilities have since increased, I amworking fulltime as a developer and technical writer that takes most of my time and I also been working on upskilling trying to get better by the day.

            Well I have a huge announcement to make! Wait for it&hellip;
I am learning GraphQL 😱
I just finished my first tutorial on EDX. I am pretty stoked about it, its something I have been putting off for months mainly because of two reasons:
I have been insanely busy and, I have been feeling overwhelmed lately about the ton of stuff I have to learn as a developer. When you hear people say as that As a developer the learning never stops, its definitely not a cliche.

            The calamity and threat brought by the pandemic had us locked away in our homes for months. As we came out of the lockdown we were forced to introspect and confront systematic and institutionalized prejudices(be it racism, ableism, ageism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, religious prejudice or any form of prejudice that exists thereof) which act as barriers to social and economic inclusion.
The catalyst to this awareness and movement was the untimely death of Gorge Floyd, a victim of police brutality and racism in Minneapolis, Minnesota USA.
